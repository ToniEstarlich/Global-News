# Header Component

## Overview
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/header_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
The `headerComponent` is a reusable web component designed for the `Global News` project. It features a dynamic slider displaying key news highlights, complete with navigation controls for a seamless user experience.

---

## Features
- **News Highlights Slider**: Displays a carousel of news headlines and descriptions.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Includes "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the slider.
- **Custom Web Component**: Built using the `HTMLElement` class for modularity and easy integration.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled to adapt across various screen sizes.

---

## File Details
- **Component File**: `./components/header.js`
- **Stylesheet**: `./css/header.css`
- **Wireframe Design**: `./assets/wireframes_components/header_component.png`

---

## Usage
1. **Import the Component**: Add the `header.js` file to your project.
   ```html
   <script src="./components/header.js" type="module"></script>

---
# Header Component

## Add the Custom Element

Use the `<header-component>` tag in your HTML:

```html
<header-component></header-component>
```

## Link the Stylesheet

Ensure the associated CSS file is included:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/header.css">
```

## Tests

### Location

All tests are located in:

```bash
/_tests_/headerComponent.test.js
```

### Test Cases

- **Rendering Slider Items**: Ensures the slider initializes correctly with the provided data.
- **Validating Content**: Verifies the first slider item displays the correct title and description.

### Test Results

All tests passed successfully, confirming the functionality of the `headerComponent`.

#### Test Output:

```bash
> npm test

PASS  _tests_/headerComponent.test.js
  headerComponent

Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.166 s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `NotSupportedError: This name has already been registered in the registry`

- **Cause**: The custom element was being redefined.
- **Solution**: Added a check before defining the custom element:

```javascript
if (!customElements.get('header-component')) {
  customElements.define('header-component', headerComponent);
}
```

### Issue: `HTMLElement is not defined`

- **Cause**: Jest lacks a browser environment.
- **Solution**: Install `jest-environment-jsdom`:

```bash
npm install jest-environment-jsdom
```

Update the Jest configuration in `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```

- **Wireframe Design**: `./assets/wireframes_components/about_header_component.png`

---

## Usage

### 1. Import the Component

Add the `about-header.js` file to your project:

```html
<script src="./components/About-components/about-header.js" type="module"></script>
```
### 2. Add the Custom Element

Use the `<about-header>` tag in your HTML:

```html
<about-header></about-header>
```

### 3. Link the Stylesheet

Ensure the associated CSS file is included:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/about-header.css">
```
## Test Cases

- **Rendering Header**: Ensures the about header component renders correctly with the proper title and description.
- **Responsive Layout**: Verifies that the header adjusts properly on different screen sizes.

---

---

## Test Output:

```bash
> npm test

PASS  _tests_/headerComponent.test.js
PASS  _tests_/about-header.test.js

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       7 passed, 7 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.671 s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Troubleshooting
### Issue: `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`

- **Cause**: Jest encountered an import statement but wasn't configured for ES Modules.
- **Solution**: Ensure Babel is configured to transform your code:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```
---
### Issue: `Jest encountered an unexpected token`

- **Cause**: Jest needs to be configured to support ES Modules or JSX.
- **Solution**: In your `package.json`, make sure the following configuration is added for Jest:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```
---
## Why Integrate Babel and Node Modules?

After running tests for the `about-header.js` component, you might encounter issues related to Jest not properly handling ES modules or JSX syntax. This is where Babel and the necessary node modules come into play. Here's why and how to integrate them:

### 1. **Why Use Babel?**
   Babel is a tool that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features (like ES6 modules or JSX) in your code while ensuring compatibility with older JavaScript environments. Jest, by default, may not understand the newer syntax unless you explicitly tell it to use Babel for transpiling. 

### 2. **Why Configure Jest?**
   Jest runs tests in a Node.js environment, which is different from a browser. If you're using ES modules or JSX, Jest won't be able to parse them without the right configuration. This is why we need to set up Babel to transpile the code before Jest can run the tests properly.

### 3. **Steps to Integrate Babel and Node Modules**

   - **Install Babel and Related Dependencies**:
     Babel can be integrated into your project using the following npm packages: `babel-jest`, `@babel/core`, and `@babel/preset-env`. These packages allow Jest to understand modern JavaScript syntax.

     To install Babel, run the following command in your project directory:

     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
     ```

   - **Configure Jest to Use Babel**:
     After installing Babel, you need to tell Jest to use it by adding the `transform` configuration to your `package.json`. This ensures that Jest uses Babel to transpile `.js` files during testing.

     In your `package.json`, add the following Jest configuration:

     ```json
     "jest": {
       "transform": {
         "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     This configuration ensures that all `.js` files in your project will be processed by `babel-jest` before Jest runs the tests.

### 4. **Benefit**
   By integrating Babel and configuring Jest in this way, you'll be able to use modern JavaScript features like ES modules and JSX, while also ensuring that your tests run smoothly without any syntax errors.

## Testing Documentation

### Overview
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/navbar_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
To ensure the stability and reliability of the components in **The Global News** project, a series of unit tests were implemented using **Jest** and the `@testing-library/jest-dom` package. These tests validate the functionality and correct rendering of the components, focusing on dynamic behaviour and routing.

### Tests Implemented

#### 1. Navbar Component
**File:** `_tests_/navbar.test.js`

- **Purpose:** Verify the correct behaviour and rendering of the `navbar-component` under different scenarios.
- **Key Tests:**
  - **Rendering Validation:** Ensures the navbar is correctly rendered in the DOM with the appropriate CSS classes.
  - **Dynamic Links:** Confirms that navigation links (`Home`, `About`, `Contact`) have the correct paths based on the current page:
    - **Home Page:** Links are relative to `index.html`.
    - **Subpages (e.g., Sports News):** Links adjust to use relative paths (`../../`).
  - **Social Component:** Verifies that the `social-component` is correctly included in the navbar.

#### 2. Header Component
**File:** `_tests_/headerComponent.test.js`

- **Purpose:** Test the correct rendering and functionality of the `headerComponent`.

#### 3. About Header Component
**File:** `_tests_/about-header.test.js`

- **Purpose:** Verify the rendering and layout of the header on the About page.

### How to Run the Tests
To execute the test suite, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm test
```
## Test Results

The current test suite includes a total of **11 tests** across **3 test files**, all of which pass successfully:

```yaml
Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       11 passed, 11 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        ~1.8 seconds
```
### Deprecation Warning
A warning related to the deprecated `punycode` module may appear during testing. This does not affect the functionality of the tests or the project. If necessary, you can suppress the warning by updating related dependencies in the future.

   <script src="./components/header.js" type="module"></script>

---
# Header Component

## Add the Custom Element

Use the `<header-component>` tag in your HTML:

```html
<header-component></header-component>
```

## Link the Stylesheet

Ensure the associated CSS file is included:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/header.css">
```

## Tests

  headerComponent
    ‚àö should render slider items correctly
    ‚àö should render the correct content in the first item
    ‚àö should move items on "next" button click
    ‚àö should move items on "prev" button click

Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.166 s
Ran all test suites.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `NotSupportedError: This name has already been registered in the registry`

- **Cause**: The custom element was being redefined.
- **Solution**: Added a check before defining the custom element:

```javascript
if (!customElements.get('header-component')) {
  customElements.define('header-component', headerComponent);
}
```

### Issue: `HTMLElement is not defined`

- **Cause**: Jest lacks a browser environment.
- **Solution**: Install `jest-environment-jsdom`:

```bash
npm install jest-environment-jsdom
```

Update the Jest configuration in `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```
